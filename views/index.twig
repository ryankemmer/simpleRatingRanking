    <p>Welcome to our study on <strong>Predicting the number of dots in an image.</strong></p>
    </br>
    <p>This study utilizes two distinct activities, ranking estimation and numerical estimation, in order to best 
        estimate how many dots are in an image. From this study, we want to better understand how we can aggregate 
        ordinal (i.e., ranking) and cardinal (i.e., numerical) estimate data from multiple human users into a 
        multimodal consensus estimate that best extracts crowd wisdom. </p>
    <h1 class= "py-2">Task</h1>
    <p>In this task, we want to understand how human users estimate the number of dots in an image. 
        Each task is comprised of two subtasks. The following figure is the interface of the first subtask. 
        We will first display an interface where users rank 2-8 pictures of dots in order from least to greatest. 
        Then, we will display a second interface where users will numerically estimate how many dots they think 
        are in the image.</p>

    <p><strong>Based on your own visual perception, you are required to </strong></br>
        1) Rank images in order from least to greatest number of dots (Interface A)</br>
        2) Numerically estimate how many dots are in each specific image (Interface B) 
    </p>

    <p>A demo video is provided to show all interactions available in our user interface.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add / delete an image to / from the ranking list: <strong>click</strong> on the image in the candidate sets
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        Compare an image with others in the ranking list: <strong>hover</strong> over an image in the candidate set
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        Reset the ranking list: <strong>click</strong> on any image in the candidate selection area to reset it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give a numerical estimation for the dots in an image: <strong>type</strong> the number of dots you believe are in an image
                    </li>
                </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After you have finished one question, please click “Next” button to continue to the next one. 
        <strong>There are 4 exercises in the entire user study.</strong> Each exercise includes <b>1</b> question involving ranking images, 
        and <b>2-6</b> additional questions to numerically estimate each image. In total, you will answer <b>20 questions</b>.</p> 

    <h1>When finished…</h1>
    <p>After you have finished all the <b>8 exercises</b>, there is a Demographics Questionnaire. Please complete it. When you have completed 
        the Demographics Questionnaire, a redeem code will be spawned in the page. 
        Please enter this redeem code in Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to get your compensation.</p>
